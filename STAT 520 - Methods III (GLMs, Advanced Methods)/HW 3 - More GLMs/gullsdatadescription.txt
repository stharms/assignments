Explanations to the file "input.csv"
====================================

input.csv is a semicolon-delimited table consisting of 23 columns and 111 rows (excluding a row with column names).
Each row corresponds to data from one individual glaucous gull.
The columns contain the following data,

ring:	unique identifier [individual ring number].
x97 ... x04:	sighting history from 1997 to 2004 [0, not seen; 1, seen].
sex:	sex [1, male; 2, female].
bm:	body mass [g].
hb:	head+bill length [mm].
cond:	body condition [residuals from the regression of ln(bm) against ln(hb) for each sex separately].
hcb:	hexachlorobenzene (HCB) concentration in blood [ng / g wet weight].
oxy:	oxychlordane concentration in blood [ng / g wet weight].
dde:	p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) concentration in blood [ng / g wet weight].
p99:	polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener  99 concentration in blood [ng / g wet weight].
p118:	polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener 118 concentration in blood [ng / g wet weight].
p138:	polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener 138 concentration in blood [ng / g wet weight].
p153:	polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener 153 concentration in blood [ng / g wet weight].
p170:	polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener 170 concentration in blood [ng / g wet weight].
p180:	polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener 180 concentration in blood [ng / g wet weight].
pc1:	1st principal component of all ln-transformed organochlorine levels (i.e., hcb ... p180).

There was one missing value in the "bm" column, indicated by "NA". The respective body condition was set at the sample mean (i.e., zero).
